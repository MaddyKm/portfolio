          Maddy is a native New Yorker, born and raised in upper Manhattan. With
          a background in theatre and early childhood education. She is excited
          to be diving into the world of software development and has completed
          Columbia University's Full Stack bootcamp. When she's not playing
          around with current projects, she can be found hanging out with her
          cat, bouldering, or watching bad reality tv shows.
